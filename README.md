## Title of the project: 
### Bouncing pacmen
<img src= "pacman1.png" width='100'/>

## Description of the project:
Pacmen bounces between browser width and height.
## How to Run: 
Use add button to create new pacmen. Click start game so the pacmen starts moving around. If you let them touch right wall, those will become sonic. So try to keep pulling them to left by a simple mouse click anywhere on the page. If those became sonic you can make them pacmen again by letting them touch left wall. To make it faster do simple mouse click on the page so the sonic jumps and moves fast to reach left wall.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
When sonic touches left wall we can reduce their speed so they can get normal pacman bounce.
